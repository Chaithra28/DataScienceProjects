## Overview
This Python notebook demonstrates the implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm using decision stumps as weak classifiers to perform binary classification. It includes the steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on a provided dataset. Additionally, a decision tree classifier is used for comparison purposes. The code outputs error rates for different numbers of boosting iterations and saves predictions to CSV files.

## Files
- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing features and labels.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset containing features for which predictions are made.

## Dependencies
The following Python packages are required to run the notebook:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

Install these packages using pip:  
`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`

## Code Description

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

- Load the training data from `train.csv` into a DataFrame.
- Separate the features (`X_train`) and labels (`Y_train`).
- Replace the label values: 3 with -1 and 5 with 1 for binary classification.
  
### Decision Stump Class

- A weak classifier used in AdaBoost.
- Predicts labels based on a single feature threshold.
- Can handle polarity to determine the direction of the threshold comparison.
  
### AdaBoost Class

- Implements the `AdaBoost` algorithm.
- Initializes weights for training samples.
- Iteratively trains decision stumps, updates weights based on prediction errors, and calculates classifier weights (alphas).
- Uses Gini impurity instead of error rate to update alphas and weights.
  
### Training and Evaluation

- Trains the `AdaBoost` model with different numbers of boosting iterations.
- Calculates and prints the error rate for each iteration.
- Saves predictions for the test set to CSV files, replacing labels: -1 with 3 and 1 with 5.
- Plots the error rate against the number of boosts.
  
### Decision Tree Classifier

- Trains a single decision tree for comparison.
- Evaluates and prints the accuracy on the training set.
- Predicts labels for the test set and saves to a CSV file.
  
## Usage

- Ensure that the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files are in the same directory as the notebook.
- Run the notebook cell by cell.
- View the error plot generated by the `AdaBoost` model.
- Check the output CSV files for predictions on the test set.
